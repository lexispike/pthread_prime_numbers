Q2.cpp

This program takes in a number and a thread number (n) and finds all the primes between 1 and the number using n threads. The program then prints out all the primes between 1 and the number and gives the serial and parallel times.

--HOW TO COMPILE--
g++ -lpthread Q2.cpp -o threaded_prime

OR

make threaded_prime

--HOW TO RUN--
./threaded_prime <highest number> <number of threads>

--EX OUTPUT--
